Supybot-FuckingDinner
=====================

Supybot plugin for whattomakeforfuckingdinner.com

Stole the idea/code from: https://github.com/gsf/supybot-plugins/blob/master/plugins/Yum/plugin.py

It goes to http://www.whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com and parses the output. Has a --veg option. 

And, there is also one by Hoaas. I wanted to add formatting + shortlink and I cleaned the code up a bit.

Nothing special here.
