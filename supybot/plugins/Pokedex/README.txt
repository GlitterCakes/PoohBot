This plugin provides simple Pok√©dex lookups.

You must install the pokedex module, run 'pokedex setup', and provide the path
to the resulting database.

The plugin will create a full-text lookup index when it's first loaded, in a
directory called 'pokedex-index' inside the data directory.  This may take a
few moments.

pokedex can be found here: http://git.veekun.com/?p=pokedex.git;a=summary
