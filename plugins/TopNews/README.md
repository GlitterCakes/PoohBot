Supybot-TopNews
===============

Supybot plugin to display news and stories from news.google.com. 

Supybot has a great RSS plugin that displays news from feeds, but what if you
want to just display and search for stories? Google News has a great interface
for this that can be parsed via RSS. (Their API also has support for this.)
I also wanted a fairly big and neutral source. If you only use one outlet,
it can be limiting.
