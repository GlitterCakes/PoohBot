this is a basic hunting and fishing game for supybot

move the files fishtrophy.txt and hunttrophy.txt to your bot's data folder to prevent any errors. in future versions i intend to cut this step out by having the plugin generate the files if they dont exsist already

chance of success is a % variable, 1 to 10. it is set with config plugins>HuntNFish.successRate <number 1 th 100>

the game can be turned off using config plugins.HuntNFish.enable

type of weight used is also configurable, with config plugins.HuntNFish.weightType
